  Mutation for AI and with AI.
abstract: >
  Traditional Mutation Testing applies a fixed set of mutation operators to generate mutants for the purpose of test assessment. However, the potential of mutants extends significantly beyond mere test evaluation. In this talk, I will share my experiences in exploring the power the mutants in testing and improving AI trustworthiness (Mutation for AI) in various AI systems, as well as a recent practice that leverages large language models for more powerful mutants (AI for Mutation).
