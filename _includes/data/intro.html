                  <p><span>Mutation analysis involves <i>mutation</i> of software artifacts that are then used to evaluate the quality of software verification tools and techniques. It is considered the premier technique for evaluating the fault revealing effectiveness of test suites, test generation techniques and other testing approaches. Ideas derived from mutation analysis have also been used to test artifacts at different levels of abstraction, including requirements, formal specifications, models, architectural design notations and even informal descriptions. Recently, mutation has played an important role in software engineering for AI, such as in verifying learned models and behaviors. Furthermore, researchers and practitioners have investigated diverse forms of mutation, such as training data or test data mutation, in combination with metamorphic testing to evaluate model performance in machine learning and detecting adversarial examples.</span></p>

                 <p>Mutation 2024 is the 19<sup>th</sup> in the series of
                    international workshops focusing on mutation analysis. The
                    workshop will be co-located with the
                    International Conference on Software Testing, Verification,
                    and Validation (<a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icst-2024">ICST
                    2024</a>). Accepted
                    papers will be published as part of the ICST
                    proceedings.</p>

                <p>The Mutation workshop aims to be
                    the premier forum for practitioners and researchers to discuss recent advances in
                    the area and propose new research directions. We invite submission of full and short length research paper, full and short length industry papers, and ‘Hot Off the Press’ presentations.</p><br>
