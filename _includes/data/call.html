  <li><span>Evaluation of mutation-based test adequacy criteria, and comparative studies with other test adequacy criteria.</span></li>
  <li><span>Formal theoretical analysis of mutation testing.</span></li>
  <li><span>Empirical studies on any aspects of mutation testing.</span></li>
  <li><span>Mutation based generation of program variants.</span></li>
  <li><span>Higher-order mutation testing.</span></li>

</ul>

<h2><a name=TOC-Types-of-Submissions></a>Types of Submissions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>Five types of submissions can be made to the workshop:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
  <li><span>Full research papers (10 pages including references): Research, case studies.</span></li>
  <li><span>Short research papers (6 pages including references): Research in progress, tools.</span></li>
  <li><span>Full industrial papers (6 pages including references): Applications and lessons learned in industry.</span></li>
  <li><span>Short industrial papers (2 pages including references): Mutation testing in practice reports.</span></li>
  <li><span>Hot Off the Press presentations (1 page abstract): Presentation of work recently published in other venues and relevant to the workshop.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>
Each paper must conform to the two columns <a
href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html"><span
style='color:#551A8B'>IEEE conference publication format</span></a>
(please use the letter format template and conference option) and must
be submitted in PDF format via <!--<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icstw24"><span style='color:#551A8B'>EasyChair</span></a>-->Easychair. Submissions will be
evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work and
to their ability to generate discussions between the participants of
the workshop. Each submission will be reviewed by three reviewers, and
all accepted papers will be published as part of the ICST proceedings.
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span>
Mutation 2024 will employ a <b>double-anonymous</b> review process. 
Authors <b>must</b> make every effort to anonymise their papers to hide their identities throughout the review process, except for Hot Off the Press submissions.
See the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/track/icst-2024/icst-2024-papers#Submitting-to-ICST2024-Q-A">double-anonymous QnA page</a> for more information.
